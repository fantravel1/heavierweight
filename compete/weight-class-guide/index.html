      Weight classes exist to create fair competition between athletes of similar size. Choosing the right class is part strategy, part self-awareness—and the best choice for you depends on your goals.

    <h2>Women's Weight Classes</h2>
    <p>
      Different federations use slightly different classes. Here are the major ones:

    <h2>What's Your "Natural" Weight Class?</h2>
    <p>
      Your natural weight class is where you walk around when you're training hard, eating well, and not actively cutting or gaining weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      For most recreational and intermediate competitors, competing at or near your natural weight makes sense. Heavy cuts don't make you stronger—they make you lighter and often weaker.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-title">The 2-Hour Weigh-In Advantage</div>
      <p style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">IPF/USAPL uses 2-hour weigh-ins, meaning you have 2 hours between weighing in and competing. This allows for moderate water cuts (typically 2-4% of bodyweight) followed by rehydration. USPA and other federations often use 24-hour weigh-ins, allowing for larger cuts.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Should You Cut Weight?</h2>

    <div class="decision-box">
      <h4>Consider Cutting If...</h4>
      <ul style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">
        <li>You're within 2-3 kg of a weight class</li>
        <li>The competition is important enough to justify it</li>
        <li>You've practiced cutting before and know how your body responds</li>
        <li>You have a coach or experienced lifter guiding you</li>
        <li>You can do it without extreme measures</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="decision-box">
      <h4>Don't Cut If...</h4>
      <ul style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">
        <li>It's your first competition (just make weight naturally)</li>
        <li>The cut would be more than 5% of your bodyweight</li>
        <li>You have a history of disordered eating</li>
        <li>The competition isn't important (local meet, just for fun)</li>
        <li>You're still building strength and muscle</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Should You Move Up?</h2>
    <p>
      Moving to a heavier weight class means you don't have to cut, but you'll face larger competitors. Consider it if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You're constantly struggling to make weight</li>
      <li>Your lifts improve significantly when you eat more</li>
      <li>You're at the top of your current class but hitting ceilings</li>
      <li>You're lean and would need extreme cuts to stay in your class</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Trade-Off</h3>
    <p>
      Moving up means accepting a lower ranking in your new class—at least initially. You might go from competitive to middle-of-the-pack. That's okay if it means better long-term progress and less stress around meets.
    </p>

    <h2>Strategic Considerations</h2>

    <h3>Competition Level Matters</h3>
    <p>
      At local meets, weight classes matter less. The goal is often just to compete and have fun. At national and international levels, weight class choice becomes more strategic because you're competing against the best in each class.
    </p>

    <h3>Check the Records</h3>
    <p>
      Before choosing a weight class, look at the current records and rankings. Some classes are more competitive than others. A class where you can be competitive might serve you better than one where you're far behind.
    </p>

    <h3>Long-Term Thinking</h3>
    <p>
      Where will you be in 2-3 years? If you're naturally gaining muscle and bodyweight as you get stronger, fighting to stay in a lower class may not make sense. Plan for where you're heading, not just where you are.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-title">Quality Over Quantity</div>
      <p style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">A 400kg total in the 63kg class is the same as a 400kg total in the 69kg class in absolute terms. But relative strength (DOTS score) rewards lighter lifters. If ranking and relative strength matter to you, staying lighter can be advantageous.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Water Cutting Basics</h2>
    <p>
      If you do decide to cut, here's a responsible approach for 2-hour weigh-ins:
    </p>

    <h3>One Week Out</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce sodium gradually</li>
      <li>Increase water intake to 1-1.5 gallons daily</li>
      <li>Keep food intake normal</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Two Days Out</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Begin water reduction (cut to half normal intake)</li>
      <li>Reduce carbohydrate intake</li>
      <li>Keep sodium very low</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Day Before</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Minimal water (sips only)</li>
      <li>Light, low-residue foods</li>
      <li>Hot bath or sauna if needed for final cut</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>After Weigh-In</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediately begin rehydrating (electrolyte drinks)</li>
      <li>Eat carb-rich, easily digestible foods</li>
      <li>Don't overeat—just restore</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color: #f97316; font-weight: 600;">
      Warning: Extreme weight cutting is dangerous. Never cut more than you've practiced, and consider working with a coach your first time.
    </p>

    <h2>For Beginners: Keep It Simple</h2>
    <p>
      Your first competition shouldn't involve a weight cut. Sign up for whatever class you naturally fall into. The goal is to learn the meet experience—not to optimize everything perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you compete more, you'll develop a sense of what class fits you best. Some lifters experiment with different classes over years before finding their home.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cutting too much:</strong> Large cuts hurt performance more than the weight class advantage helps</li>
      <li><strong>Cutting for local meets:</strong> Save aggressive cuts for important competitions</li>
      <li><strong>Ignoring the scale:</strong> Know your walking-around weight so you're never surprised</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional decisions:</strong> "I want to be in the 57s" is not a good reason if you walk around at 65</li>
      <li><strong>First-meet cuts:</strong> Adding cut stress to first-meet stress is a recipe for a bad experience</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-title">The Bottom Line</div>
      <p style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">Choose the weight class where you can compete without compromising your health or performance. For most lifters, that's within 2-3 kg of your natural walking weight. Save aggressive cuts for when they really matter.</p>
