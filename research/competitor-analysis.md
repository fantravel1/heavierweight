## Detailed Competitor Breakdown

### BarBend

**Overview:** Largest strength sports media site. Covers powerlifting, weightlifting, strongman, CrossFit, bodybuilding.

**Strengths:**
- Massive authority and traffic
- Comprehensive competition coverage
- Strong affiliate revenue (equipment reviews)
- Large content library

**Weaknesses:**
- Generic approach to women's content
- Often rehashed or superficial women's articles

**Strengths:**
- Strong women-focused brand
- Quality educational content
- Expert contributor network
- Pregnancy/postpartum expertise

**Weaknesses:**
- Content gated behind certifications
- Focus on coaches, not lifters
