## Content Gaps to Own

### Plus-Size Representation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**No competitor adequately addresses plus-size lifters.**

Content opportunities:
- Equipment sizing for larger bodies (belts, singlets, knee sleeves)
- Technique modifications for different body types
- Weight class strategy for superheavy competitors
- Athlete profiles: Brittany Schlater, Bonica Brown, Tamara Walcott

**Strategy**: Feature diverse body types throughout ALL content naturally, not in separate "body positive" articles.

### Medical Crossover Content
**Women searching for condition-specific lifting guidance find almost nothing.**

Content opportunities:
- PCOS and strength training
- Endometriosis considerations
- Thyroid conditions and training
- Autoimmune diseases
- Discussing lifting with healthcare providers
