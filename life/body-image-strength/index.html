    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #fff; line-height: 1.8;">
      Strength sports offer something rare: a space where your body is valued for what it can do, not how it looks. But that doesn't mean body image struggles disappear. Here's how to build a healthier relationship with your body as a lifter.
    </p>

    <h2>The Shift in Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      Most women grow up in a culture that treats their bodies as objects to be looked at—evaluated, judged, and improved for the viewing pleasure of others. The goal is always appearance: smaller, smoother, more acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strength sports offer a different framework: your body is an instrument. What matters is what it can do. Can it squat? How much? Can it pull heavy things off the floor? Can it press weight overhead?
    </p>
    <p>
      This shift—from body as object to body as instrument—can be profoundly healing.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
      "For the first time in my life, I didn't care what my body looked like. I cared what it could do. And the more I focused on performance, the less I worried about the mirror."
    </div>

    <h2>The Complicated Reality</h2>
    <p>
      But it's not always that simple. Many lifters still struggle:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Weight class sports create pressure around body size</li>
      <li>Social media shows carefully curated "lifting bodies"</li>
      <li>Comments from others can undermine progress</li>
      <li>Old habits and beliefs don't disappear overnight</li>
      <li>The fitness industry still sells appearance over performance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Moving from appearance-focused to performance-focused takes time. It's a process, not a switch.
    </p>

    <h2>Weight Classes: Navigating the Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Competing in weight classes means thinking about body weight in ways that can be triggering for some people.
    </p>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>Healthy Approach</h4>
      <ul style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">
        <li>Compete at or near your natural weight</li>
        <li>Don't chase weight classes that require extreme restriction</li>
        <li>See weight as one variable, not your identity</li>
        <li>Focus on strength-to-bodyweight ratio, not just weight</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>Warning Signs</h4>
      <ul style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">
        <li>Obsessive weighing or body checking</li>
        <li>Extreme restriction between meets</li>
        <li>Mood completely tied to scale numbers</li>
        <li>Avoiding food socially</li>
        <li>Injuries or health issues from weight manipulation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-title">If You Have a History of Eating Disorders</div>
      <p style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">Weight class sports may not be the right fit, or may require extra support. Consider competing without cutting weight, or in a non-weight-class format. Your long-term health matters more than any competition. If needed, work with a therapist who understands athletes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Changing What You Value</h2>

    <h3>New Metrics of Success</h3>
    <p>
      Start measuring yourself by new standards:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>PR weights lifted, not pounds lost</li>
      <li>Technique improvements, not appearance changes</li>
      <li>Consistency of training, not perfection of diet</li>
      <li>How you feel, not how you look</li>
      <li>Competition results, not mirror assessments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reframing "Big"</h3>
    <p>
      Many women are conditioned to want to be small. Strength sports require—and build—muscle. Your body will change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider: "Big" in a lifting context means powerful, capable, strong. Wide shoulders carry more weight. Thick thighs squat more. These are adaptations that serve your goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      It takes time to see these changes as gains rather than problems. Be patient with yourself.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
      "My thighs don't fit in the jeans I wore in college. But they squat 150kg. I'm choosing strength over arbitrary sizing."
    </div>

    <h2>Dealing with Comments</h2>
    <p>
      People will comment on your body. Some mean well; some don't.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Comments and Reframes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>"You're getting bulky"</strong> → "I'm getting stronger."</li>
      <li><strong>"Aren't you worried about looking masculine?"</strong> → "I'm not worried about what I look like. I care about what I can do."</li>
      <li><strong>"You should do more cardio"</strong> → "I'm training for my goals, not yours."</li>
      <li><strong>"You're too muscular"</strong> → "For what? I'm exactly muscular enough for what I do."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setting Boundaries</h3>
    <p>
      You don't owe anyone explanations about your body. It's okay to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change the subject</li>
      <li>Say "I'd rather not discuss my body"</li>
      <li>Walk away</li>
      <li>Limit time with people who make you feel bad</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Social Media Reality Check</h2>
    <p>
      The lifters you see on Instagram are not representative:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lighting, angles, and timing are curated</li>
      <li>You're seeing highlight reels, not daily reality</li>
      <li>Many have been training for years or decades</li>
      <li>Genetic variation is real—bodies look different</li>
      <li>Some images are edited or enhanced</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Curate your feed for inspiration, not comparison. Unfollow accounts that make you feel bad about yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>Building a Healthy Relationship</h2>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>Practice Gratitude for Function</h4>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">After training, acknowledge what your body just did. "My legs just squatted 100kg." "My back just deadlifted 120." This body carried that weight. That's remarkable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>Separate Performance from Appearance</h4>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">You can have a bad body image day and still lift well. You can feel great about your body and have a bad training day. They're not as connected as we think.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="insight-box">
      <h4>Focus on Process</h4>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">Bodies change slowly. Progress happens workout by workout. Keep your attention on what you can control today—showing up, doing the work, eating well—rather than obsessing over outcomes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>When to Seek Help</h2>
    <p>
      Body image struggles exist on a spectrum. Consider professional support if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Thoughts about your body interfere with daily life</li>
      <li>You're restricting food in unhealthy ways</li>
      <li>You can't enjoy training because of body concerns</li>
      <li>You avoid activities or situations because of your body</li>
      <li>Past eating disorders are being triggered</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Therapists who specialize in athletes and body image can help. This is not weakness—it's taking care of yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
    <p>
      Strength sports can be part of healing your relationship with your body. But they're not a magic cure. The work is internal—shifting beliefs, building new patterns, and learning to value yourself beyond appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time you focus on what you can do instead of how you look, you're building a new way of relating to your body. It gets easier with practice.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-title">The Bottom Line</div>
      <p style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">Your body is an instrument, not an ornament. Train it, fuel it, rest it, and appreciate it for what it can do. The more you focus on performance, the less space there is for destructive appearance obsession. It's not about ignoring your body—it's about valuing it for the right reasons.</p>
