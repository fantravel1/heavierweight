## Executive Summary

**HEAVIERWEIGHT.COM** fills the massive gap between general strength media (BarBend), certification-focused platforms (Girls Gone Strong), and app-based programming (Stronger By The Day). No competitor currently owns the intersection of:

- ✅ Evidence-based, research-backed content
- ✅ Competitive lifting focus (powerlifting, Olympic weightlifting)
- ✅ Women-specific depth across all skill levels
- ✅ Inclusive of all body types (without explicit "body positive" messaging)

This repository contains the complete 12-24 month editorial roadmap, site architecture, keyword strategy, and content specifications.

## Content Gaps to Own

### 1. Plus-Size Representation (HIGH PRIORITY)

- When to enter first meet (skill/strength benchmarks)
- Local → regional → national → international pathway
- Cost breakdown of competitive lifting annually
- Federation ranking systems explained

Content opportunities:

- Finding a qualified coach
- Competition pathway (local meets to nationals)
- Paris 2024 coverage creates momentum

### 5. Medical Crossover Content

Content opportunities:
- PCOS and strength training
- Endometriosis considerations
- Thyroid conditions and training
- Autoimmune diseases
- Discussing lifting with healthcare providers

### 6. Masters-Specific Content

**Women over 40 are fastest-growing demographic in strength sports.**
