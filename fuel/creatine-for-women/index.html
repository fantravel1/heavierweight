    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #fff; line-height: 1.8;">
      Creatine is not just for men. It's one of the few supplements with overwhelming evidence for safety and effectiveness—and women may actually benefit more from it than they realize.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is Creatine?</h2>
    <p>
      Creatine is a molecule naturally produced by your body (primarily in the liver) from amino acids. It's stored in your muscles as phosphocreatine, where it helps regenerate ATP—your muscles' primary energy source for short, intense efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also get creatine from food, primarily red meat and fish. But dietary intake alone doesn't fully saturate muscle stores, which is where supplementation helps.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits for Female Lifters</h2>

    <div class="benefit-box">
      <h4>Increased Strength & Power</h4>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">Multiple studies show 5-15% improvements in high-intensity exercise performance. More reps, more weight, more progress.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit-box">
      <h4>Improved Recovery</h4>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">Creatine may reduce muscle damage and inflammation following intense training, helping you recover faster between sessions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit-box">
      <h4>Enhanced Muscle Growth</h4>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">By allowing you to train harder and recover better, creatine indirectly supports muscle hypertrophy. Some research also suggests direct effects on muscle protein synthesis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit-box">
      <h4>Cognitive Benefits</h4>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">Your brain uses creatine too. Studies show benefits for cognitive function, especially under stress or sleep deprivation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="benefit-box">
      <h4>Potential Mood Benefits</h4>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">Emerging research suggests creatine may have antidepressant effects, particularly in women. More studies are needed, but initial findings are promising.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why Women May Benefit Especially</h2>
    <p>
      Women typically have lower baseline creatine stores than men for several reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lower dietary intake (women eat less meat on average)</li>
      <li>Less muscle mass to store creatine</li>
      <li>Hormonal differences affecting creatine metabolism</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This means women may see proportionally greater benefits from supplementation—they have more room for improvement.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-title">Research Note</div>
      <p style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">Most creatine research has been done on men. However, the studies that include women show similar or better response to supplementation. We need more female-specific research, but the existing evidence is strongly positive.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How to Take Creatine</h2>

    <h3>Dosing</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Standard dose:</strong> 3-5g per day, every day. This is simple and effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Loading phase (optional):</strong> 20g per day (split into 4 doses) for 5-7 days, then maintain with 3-5g daily. This saturates stores faster but isn't necessary—you'll reach the same point with consistent daily dosing, it just takes 3-4 weeks instead of 1.
    </p>

    <h3>Timing</h3>
    <p>
      It doesn't matter much. Some research suggests post-workout may be slightly better, but the difference is minimal. Consistency matters more than timing. Pick a time you'll remember and stick to it.
    </p>

    <h3>Form</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Creatine monohydrate</strong> is the gold standard. It's the most researched, most effective, and cheapest. Ignore fancy forms like "buffered creatine" or "creatine HCL"—they're not proven to be better and cost more.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Take It</h3>
    <p>
      Mix with water, juice, or your protein shake. It dissolves best in warm liquid but works fine in cold. Some people add it to coffee. Doesn't matter—just get it in.
    </p>

    <h2>Myths Debunked</h2>

    <div class="myth-box">
      <div class="myth">MYTH: Creatine causes bloating and weight gain in women</div>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">Creatine does cause some water retention—but it's intramuscular (inside the muscle cells), not subcutaneous (under the skin). You might see 1-3 lbs on the scale, but you won't look puffy or bloated. That water is inside your muscles, making them fuller.</p>
      <div class="truth">TRUTH: Any weight gain is muscle water, not fat or visible bloating</div>
    </div>

    <div class="myth-box">
      <div class="myth">MYTH: Creatine is a steroid</div>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">Creatine has zero hormonal effects. It's not related to steroids in any way. It's a naturally occurring compound found in food. It's legal in all sports and completely safe.</p>
      <div class="truth">TRUTH: Creatine is a natural compound with no hormonal effects</div>
    </div>

    <div class="myth-box">
      <div class="myth">MYTH: Creatine damages your kidneys</div>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">This myth persists despite decades of research showing no kidney damage in healthy individuals. Creatine does elevate creatinine levels (a waste product), which can look concerning on blood tests, but this is a benign marker—not actual kidney stress.</p>
      <div class="truth">TRUTH: Safe for healthy kidneys; tell your doctor you take it before blood tests</div>
    </div>

    <div class="myth-box">
      <div class="myth">MYTH: You need to cycle off creatine</div>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">There's no evidence that taking creatine continuously is harmful or reduces its effectiveness. Your body doesn't "get used to it." Take it daily, indefinitely.</p>
      <div class="truth">TRUTH: No cycling needed—take it consistently</div>
    </div>

    <div class="myth-box">
      <div class="myth">MYTH: Creatine causes hair loss</div>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">This comes from one study showing increased DHT (a hormone linked to hair loss) in rugby players. The study has never been replicated, and no subsequent research has found hair loss effects. If you're genetically predisposed to hair loss, it may happen anyway—but creatine isn't the cause.</p>
      <div class="truth">TRUTH: No reliable evidence links creatine to hair loss</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Who Should Consider Creatine</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Anyone doing strength training or high-intensity exercise</li>
      <li>Athletes in power and strength sports</li>
      <li>Vegetarians and vegans (no dietary creatine from meat)</li>
      <li>Older women concerned about muscle maintenance</li>
      <li>Anyone wanting a safe, effective, evidence-based supplement</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who Should Be Cautious</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Those with pre-existing kidney disease (consult your doctor)</li>
      <li>People taking certain medications (ask your doctor about interactions)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For healthy individuals, there are no known contraindications. When in doubt, consult a healthcare provider.
    </p>

    <h2>What to Buy</h2>
    <p>
      Look for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Creatine monohydrate</strong> (not other forms)</li>
      <li><strong>Third-party tested</strong> (NSF Certified for Sport, Informed Sport, or similar)</li>
      <li><strong>No unnecessary additives</strong> (just creatine)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Reputable brands include: Thorne, NOW Foods, Optimum Nutrition, BulkSupplements. Creatine is cheap—expect to pay $15-30 for a few months' supply.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-title">The Bottom Line</div>
      <p style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">Creatine is one of the few supplements with robust evidence for safety and effectiveness. For women who lift, it's a no-brainer: cheap, safe, and genuinely helpful. 3-5g daily of creatine monohydrate. That's it.</p>
