      Attempt selection is where meets are won or lost. Smart attempt choices separate experienced competitors from those who bomb out or leave kilos on the platform. Here's how to think about each attempt strategically.
    </p>

    <h2>The Philosophy: Conservative to Aggressive</h2>
    <p>
      Your three attempts serve different purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First attempt:</strong> Get on the board. Build confidence. Zero risk.</li>
      <li><strong>Second attempt:</strong> Secure a solid total. Modest PR territory.</li>
      <li><strong>Third attempt:</strong> Go for it. This is where you push limits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The key principle: each successful attempt gives you information and confidence for the next. A missed opener puts you in a hole; a made opener sets up the meet.
    </p>

    <h2>First Attempts (Openers)</h2>

    <div class="attempt-card">
      <h4>The Rule: Something You Can Hit on Your Worst Day</h4>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">Your opener should be a weight you can triple on a bad day in the gym. For most lifters, this means roughly 88-92% of your planned third attempt, or about 90% of your current max. When in doubt, go lighter.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Why Conservative Openers Matter</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Competition is different from training—nerves, timing, commands</li>
      <li>A made lift builds momentum and calms nerves</li>
      <li>Missing your opener is psychologically devastating</li>
      <li>You only get three attempts—don't waste one on ego</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-title">The Math on Openers</div>
      <p style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">If your gym max is 100kg, a smart opener is 87-90kg. This leaves room for second (95-97kg) and third (100-105kg) attempts with reasonable jumps. Starting at 95kg leaves no room to build.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example-box">
      <h5>Example: 150kg Squat Goal</h5>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">
        • Opener: 132.5-135kg (88-90%)<br>
        • Second: 142.5-145kg (95-97%)<br>
        • Third: 150-152.5kg (100-102%)
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Second Attempts</h2>

    <div class="attempt-card">
      <h4>The Rule: Secure Your Total</h4>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">Your second attempt should be something you're highly confident you can make. Around 95-97% of your planned max, or a weight you've hit for a solid single recently. This is where your "real" total comes from.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Decision Framework</h3>
    <p>
      After your opener, assess:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How did it move?</strong> Fast and easy = take planned jump. Slow or hard = smaller jump or repeat.</li>
      <li><strong>How do you feel?</strong> Energy high = proceed as planned. Tired or off = be conservative.</li>
      <li><strong>What do you need?</strong> Going for placement = might need to adjust. Just totaling = stick to plan.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <strong>The Biggest Second Attempt Mistake</strong>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 8px 0 0 0;">Taking too big a jump after an easy opener. Your opener felt easy because you planned it that way. That doesn't mean you should add 15kg to your second. Stick to planned increments.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Third Attempts</h2>

    <div class="attempt-card">
      <h4>The Rule: This Is Your Shot</h4>
      <p style="color: #a0a0a0; margin: 0;">Third attempts are where you take calculated risks. Your total is secured from your seconds. Now you can push for PRs, make up for a missed lift, or go for placement. This is the attempt to remember.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Third Attempt Scenarios</h3>

    <h4>Scenario 1: Everything Went Well</h4>
    <p>
      Both prior attempts were smooth. Take your planned third or add a small amount if you're feeling great. Don't get greedy—a PR is still a PR.
    </p>

    <h4>Scenario 2: Second Was Hard</h4>
    <p>
      Take a small jump or repeat your second. A made lift beats a missed third. You can always come back next meet.
    </p>

    <h4>Scenario 3: You Missed Your Second</h4>
    <p>
      Options: Repeat the weight or take a small reduction. Don't try to "make up" kilos by jumping higher. Secure a total.
    </p>

    <h4>Scenario 4: Competing for Placement</h4>
    <p>
      This changes the calculus. You might need to take a bigger third to win or place. Weigh the risk/reward. Sometimes the smart play is taking a weight you might miss.
    </p>

    <h2>Jump Sizes</h2>
    <p>
      Standard jumps between attempts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Squat:</strong> 5-10kg typical, 12.5kg maximum</li>
      <li><strong>Bench:</strong> 2.5-5kg typical, 7.5kg maximum</li>
      <li><strong>Deadlift:</strong> 5-10kg typical, 12.5kg maximum</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Smaller lifters typically take smaller jumps; larger lifters can take bigger jumps. These are guidelines, not rules—adjust based on your strength level.
    </p>

    <h2>Planning Your Attempts Before the Meet</h2>
    <p>
      Come to the meet with a plan, but be ready to adjust:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Set your goal third attempts based on recent training</li>
      <li>Work backward to set seconds (97% of third) and openers (90% of third)</li>
      <li>Write down alternative scenarios: "If opener feels hard, take X for second"</li>
      <li>Have a handler or coach who knows your plan</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-title">The Attempt Card</div>
      <p style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">Write out your planned attempts plus contingencies on an index card. Include: Goal attempts, backup attempts, minimum acceptable total. Give a copy to your handler. This prevents emotional decisions in the moment.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

    <h3>Opening Too Heavy</h3>
    <p>
      The #1 mistake. Opens should be easy. If you're nervous about your opener, it's too heavy. A missed opener demoralizes you and puts you two attempts behind.
    </p>

    <h3>Big Jumps After Easy Attempts</h3>
    <p>
      Your opener felt easy because it was supposed to. That's not new information. Stick to planned jumps.
    </p>

    <h3>Chasing Other Competitors</h3>
    <p>
      Worry about your lifts, not theirs. The best strategy is executing your plan. Changing attempts based on what others do usually backfires.
    </p>

    <h3>Emotional Third Attempts</h3>
    <p>
      "I need to hit 200" after missing 190 twice. No, you need to total. Take a makeable third. Live to lift another day.
    </p>

    <h2>The 9/9 Mindset</h2>
    <p>
      Your goal for most meets should be going 9 for 9—making all nine attempts. This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conservative openers you cannot miss</li>
      <li>Solid seconds that lock in your total</li>
      <li>Reasonable thirds that challenge but don't destroy you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A 9/9 meet with modest PRs beats a 5/9 meet with one big lift. Consistency builds championships.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <div class="callout-title">The Bottom Line</div>
      <p style="margin: 0; color: #a0a0a0;">Open light. Build through seconds. Push on thirds. Have a plan, trust your coach, and don't let ego override strategy. The platform rewards patience and smart decisions—not just strength.</p>
