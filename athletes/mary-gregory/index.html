      <h2>Never Too Late</h2>
      <p>
        Mary Gregory didn't pick up a barbell until her late 40s. Like many women her age, she'd spent decades thinking the weight room wasn't for her—that heavy lifting was for young athletes, not middle-aged mothers.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was wrong, and she's spent years since proving it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as a way to stay healthy during perimenopause turned into a competitive pursuit. Within a few years of consistent training, Mary was setting state and national records in masters powerlifting. Not just participating—winning.
      </p>

      <div class="quote">
        "I wasted so many years being intimidated by barbells. Now I tell every woman over 40: you're not too old. You're just getting started. The best time to start was 20 years ago. The second best time is today."
      </div>

      <h2>The Masters Advantage</h2>
      <p>
        Contrary to what many believe, older athletes have advantages that younger lifters don't:
      </p>
      <ul style="color: #a0a0a0; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Patience developed over decades of life experience</li>
        <li>Better ability to follow programs consistently</li>
        <li>Less ego, more willingness to learn</li>
        <li>Appreciation for the process, not just the results</li>
        <li>Stronger motivation—this isn't just for fun, it's for quality of life</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Mary embodies all of these. Her training is methodical, patient, and relentlessly consistent. She doesn't chase PRs every week—she builds toward them over months and years.
      </p>

      <h2>Training Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Mary's approach to training reflects hard-won wisdom:
      </p>
      <ul style="color: #a0a0a0; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Recovery is non-negotiable—sleep and nutrition come first</li>
        <li>Technique before load, always</li>
        <li>Listen to the body—some days call for backing off</li>
        <li>Consistency over heroics—show up every week</li>
        <li>Find joy in the process—competition is the bonus</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="quote">
        "I used to think I was too old, too broken, too far behind. Now I realize those were just stories I told myself. The body adapts at any age. You just have to give it the chance."
      </div>

      <h2>Health Transformation</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the records, Mary's story is about health transformation. When she started lifting:
      </p>
      <ul style="color: #a0a0a0; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Bone density improved after years of decline</li>
        <li>Chronic back pain disappeared</li>
        <li>Blood markers improved across the board</li>
        <li>Energy and sleep quality transformed</li>
        <li>Confidence reached levels she'd never experienced</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        "My doctor couldn't believe my numbers," she says. "She asked what medication I was taking. I told her: barbells."
      </p>

      <h2>Advice for Women Starting Later</h2>
      <p>
        Mary is passionate about helping other women discover what she did:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Find a good coach—someone who understands masters athletes. Start lighter than you think you need to. Be patient with yourself. And ignore anyone who says you're too old. They don't know what they're talking about."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Your body will surprise you. Mine certainly surprised me. I'm stronger at 55 than I was at 25. That's not an exaggeration—it's just what happens when you actually train."
      </p>

      <h2>Impact Beyond Competition</h2>
      <p>
        Mary's influence extends beyond her own lifting. She's become an advocate for masters athletes, speaking at gyms and events about the benefits of strength training for older women. Her social media following includes thousands of women who found inspiration in her journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Every week I get messages from women who started lifting because of something I posted. That means more to me than any record. If I can help even one woman realize she's not too old, everything was worth it."
      </p>

      <h2>Equipment Preferences</h2>
      <ul style="color: #a0a0a0; line-height: 2;">
        <li><strong>Belt:</strong> Pioneer 10mm lever belt</li>
        <li><strong>Knee Sleeves:</strong> SBD (helps with aging knees)</li>
        <li><strong>Squat Shoes:</strong> Adidas Powerlift</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Emphasis on sleep, nutrition, and walks</li>
      </ul>
