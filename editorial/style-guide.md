## Writing Guidelines

### Numbers

- Use numerals for 10+
- Always use numerals for: weights (5kg), sets/reps (3x5), percentages (85%)

### Weights

- Default to kg for competition/training context
- Include lb conversion in parentheses for US audience
- Example: "a 100kg (220lb) squat"

### Terminology

| Use | Don't Use |
|-----|-----------|
| Women | Females (unless scientific context) |
| Lifters | Girls, ladies |
| Powerlifting | Power lifting |
| Weightlifting | Weight lifting (two words = general), Olympic lifting |
| Squat/Bench/Deadlift | SBD (spell out on first use) |

## Image Guidelines

### Technical Specifications

| Type | Dimensions | Format |
|------|------------|--------|
| Hero/Featured | 1200x630px | WebP (JPEG fallback) |
| In-content | 800px min width | WebP (JPEG fallback) |
| Product photos | 600x600px | WebP (JPEG fallback) |

### Representation Guidelines

**DO:**
- Feature diverse body types naturally throughout
- Show women of different ages, sizes, ethnicities
- Use real training/competition photography
- Show athletes in action, not posed

**DON'T:**
- Use stock photography
- Tokenize diversity (avoid single "diverse" image)
- Over-filter or over-edit bodies
- Use only elite-level physiques

### Alt Text

Every image needs descriptive alt text:
- Good: "Woman performing sumo deadlift with 140kg barbell at powerlifting competition"
- Bad: "Woman lifting" or "Deadlift image"

---

## Research & Citations

### Source Hierarchy

1. **Peer-reviewed studies** (PubMed, Google Scholar)
2. **Federation rules** (IPF, USAPL, IWF official sites)
3. **Expert interviews** (coaches, researchers, athletes)
4. **Reputable sports science sites** (Stronger By Science, MASS)

### Citation Format

In-text: "Research shows that women may handle higher training volumes (Smith et al., 2023)."

End of article: Link to study or provide full citation.

### When to Cite

Always cite:
- Specific statistics or percentages
- Research findings
- Expert quotes
- Federation rules

## Brand Voice Examples

### Good Examples

**Authoritative but accessible:**
> "The research is clear: menstrual cycle phase has minimal impact on strength performance for most women. A 2023 meta-analysis found no significant differences in one-rep max across cycle phases. That said, how you *feel* matters—and adjusting training based on energy levels is completely valid."

**Direct and actionable:**
> "Start with an empty barbell. Yes, really. Your first session should be about learning the movement patterns, not testing your limits. Week one focuses on technique; the weight will come."

**Inclusive without being performative:**
> "Whether you're starting at 40 or 14, squatting 50kg or 200kg, competing in the 47kg class or the 84+kg class—the principles remain the same."

### Avoid

**Condescending:**
> ~~"Don't worry, lifting won't make you bulky!"~~

**Too casual:**
> ~~"OMG you guys, deadlifts are literally the best!"~~

**Vague:**
> ~~"Make sure to eat enough protein and train hard."~~
